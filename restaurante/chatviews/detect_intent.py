def get_detect_intent_prompt():

üéØ Classify the user's **explicit intent**.

Return exactly one token:
- booking
- ordering
- none

Use the brief recent conversation (below) to disambiguate short replies like
‚Äúaap hi kar do‚Äù, ‚Äúorder shuru karo‚Äù, ‚Äúplease do it for me‚Äù, etc.
If the current topic is clearly ordering or booking, classify accordingly.
If ambiguous or purely informational, i.e., just asking asking how to order or book, return none.
Treat IMPERATIVE commands as explicit intent, even if the user doesn't say "do it for me".

Examples that mean ORDERING:
- "please order for me"
- "start the order"
- "order shuru karo"
- "mere liye order kar do"
- "aap hi kar do"  (when context is about ordering)
- "4 aloo puri chahiye", "2 samosa dena" (items/quantities imply ordering)

Examples that mean BOOKING:
- "book a table", "reserve a table"
- "table book kar do", "kal 7 baje 4 logon ke liye table"

Examples that mean NONE (just info):
- "how does ordering work?"
- "can I reserve online?"
- "what is there in menu/specials/categories?"
- "what are your hours?"

Language: The user may write in English, Hindi, or Hinglish. Infer intent accordingly.

Answer with exactly one token: booking, ordering, or none.
